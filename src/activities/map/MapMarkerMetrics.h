// findable at this size: it punches a hole in the map ink underneath.

// Sizes were judged on the glass, not calculated. First pass was ring 18 / dot 6
// / halo 3; on the panel that read as findable but too small, and the maintainer
// asked for half again, so these are those scaled by 3/2 (2026-08-19). Ring 27 is

  // The comment that stood here until 2026-09-05 said 3 px was "near the
  // thinnest line that survives on this panel at arm's length" and that 2 px
  // was "the floor". Both are wrong, and nothing ever measured them. The map
  // itself is the counter-evidence: the road style floors a visible class at
  // **1 px** (docs/map-style.md, "floors a visible class at 1 px"), tertiary
  // and unclassified roads draw as 1 px hairlines, and a 1 px line across a
  // bend of the Morava was spotted on the panel on 2026-08-08. If 1 px were
  // under the panel's floor, half the road network would be invisible.
  //
  // The claim most likely slid in from toneWayInterior's real 2 px floor, which

  // and a dash already means water (docs/map-style.md).
